Extract 1m dems for the Kings Range
Use valleyx to extract the valley floors for the area

HUC 12s that cover the range:
180101070402
180101070401
180101070201
180101070204
180101070207

Want to operate on smaller units, so will need to further segment each huc12
into smaller subcatchments using whitebox tools and nhd hr flowlines
